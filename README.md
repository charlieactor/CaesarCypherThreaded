## Threaded Caesar Cypher
### Charlie Actor with Andy Wynyard

This is a threaded Caesar Cypher - running 26 separate threads to calculate all possible decrypted versions of a message. After it is decrypted, the program looks through a dictionary and determines if the decrypted messages match words in a dictionary - then tells the user the correct decrypted message, as well as the number by which it was decrypted!

Cowritten by Andy Wynyard!
